# mean-liquid

Helps developers track, version, and deploy database changes.

Inspired by [Liquibase]; but, re-inventing the wheel â€“ the one they asked us not to ðŸ˜ˆ â€“ for the MEAN stack.

#### _**NOTE:** The library is tied to [Mongoose] for now._

## Installation
_[Back to Top](#mean-liquid)_

Install `mean-liquid` as a dev dependency:
```bash
npm i -D mean-liquid
```

Alternatively `mean-liquid` can be installed globally:
```bash
npm i -g mean-liquid
```


## Environment Setup
_[Back to Top](#mean-liquid)_

Create a `.env` file in your project root (where you've installed `mean-liquid`) with the following key/value pairs:
```env
DB_URI={{THIS SHOULD BE YOUR MONGODB DB_URI}}
MIGRATIONS_DIR=migrations
MIGRATIONS_LOG=migrations.log
```


## Getting Started
_[Back to Top](#mean-liquid)_

1. ### Start with the `db-create` executable to generate an empty migration file:
    - ```bash
        npx db-create my-first-migration
        ```
        - The migration filename(s) are determined by concatenating the migration name with the migration `_id`.
            - Example: `my-first-migration-66fb2159031d1f0103efac7d.ts`
        - The migration file(s) will be generated in your project root under the `MIGRATIONS_DIR` directory.
            - Example: `./migrations/my-first-migration-66fb2159031d1f0103efac7d.ts`

                Here's an example of what a newly generated migration file looks like:
                ```ts
                // import or write Mongoose schemas and models here...

                export async function up() {
                    // write upgrade script here... throw Error or return false to fail upgrade.
                    return true;
                }

                export async function down() {
                    // write revert script here... throw Error or return false to fail revert.
                    return true;
                }
                ```

1. ### Using the generated migration file, and the [Mongoose] library, write an `up`-grade and a `down`-grade script.
    - Here's an example; but, you may want to import pre-existing schemas and models and/or interfaces and types:
        ```ts
        import mongoose, { Schema } from 'mongoose';

        const recipeSchema = new Schema({
          author: { type: String, required: true },
          title: { type: String, required: true },
        });

        const Recipe = mongoose.model('Recipe', recipeSchema);

        export async function up() {
          await Recipe.create({
            author: 'Dustin',
            title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup',
          });

          return true;
        }

        export async function down() {
          await Recipe.deleteOne({
            author: 'Dustin',
            title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup',
          });

          return true;
        }
        ```
    - _**NOTE:** At anytime during an `up`-grade or a `down`-grade, you can `throw` an `Error`; or, simply `return false`, to mark the `up`-grade or the `down`-grade as a failure, and set the status to `APPLY_FAILED` or `REVERT_FAILED` respectively._
    - _**NOTE:** While a `down`-grade script is not strictly mandatory it will make reverting changes significantly easier._

1. ### Now it's time to run the `db-up` executable:
    - ```bash
        npx db-up my-first-migration
        ```

1. ### Then we can check the status of the migration is `APPLIED`:
    - First run the `db-status` executable:
        - ```bash
            npx db-status my-first-migration
            ```
    - Then check the `CHANGELOG` collection in your database, to find the migration document, and ensure the `status` is `APPLIED`.

1. ### Now, if you created a `down`-grade script, run the revert with the `db-down` executable:
    - ```bash
        npx db-down my-first-migration
        ```

1. ### Then we can check the status of the migration is `REVERTED`:
    - First run the `db-status` executable:
        - ```bash
            npx db-status my-first-migration
            ```
    - Then check the `CHANGELOG` collection in your database, to find the migration document, and ensure the `status` is `REVERTED`.
